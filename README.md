# ng-rest-model
A JavaScript model class for easily calling REST API inspired by Laravel's ORM

# Warning

With annotations a complete rethink of code design came. So versions above 0.0.7
are not compatible with versions until 0.0.7!

This module is under hard development but is usable already. However, there is no
warranty that it won't fail in some situations.

## Upcoming improvements

- Unit tests
- Finish documentation
- Investigation in cases of FetchMode.EAGER (may buggy with no value loaded eagerly
and in different conjunctions with async parameter)

## Usage

[See in the docs](docs/Usage.md)

## Documentation

[Link](docs/README.md)

## Contributing

Any contribution is welcome if the goal is not missed: to have a useful ORM
like service that not fits for every situation but for most of the cases and is
easily configurable.
